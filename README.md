# Steward
A modern pantry management system

## Update
I've spent some time thinking and learning about food waste, and I've decided to slightly change the focus of this project. Instead of just telling users to throw away food when the manufacturer wants them to, the system will allow users to contribute data on how long a specific food item lasted beyond the listed date, and provide recommendations based on data rather than marketing.
I also regret not making the progress on this project that I had hoped I could. I have been spending a lot of time working my actual job, but I've also had time to advance this project that I haven't taken advantage of.

## Project in Progress
Steward is currently in the early concept and research phase. 

# System Concept
Feeding America, a non-profit organization focused on reducing hunger in the US, states that about 39% of the nearly 120 million pounds of food waste per year in America comes from homes. Some simple math places this at around $159 billion in wasted food. This is likely an overestimate, but if the true value of food wasted in homes is even half of this, it means that on average, American households throw away about $640 worth of food every year. Steward will help to address this problem by keeping track of the items in the fridge or pantry. Your Steward will remind you when items are nearing expiration, giving you a chance to keep them from being wasted. Users can also add others to their list, so that family members or roommates can utilize Steward as well. Steward could additionally track where items are stored, helping users to easily locate them. 

A major focus of Steward is ease of use. The use of computer vision will help minimize the time and effort needed in logging items. Steward should always be a tool that feels helpful and never obstructive or annoying.

# Current Plans
Implement using:
- PostgreSQL
- Express.js
- React Native

## Update
- Due to my school workload, I had to put the project on hold.
- I hope to pick this project back up in mid-May

# Goals

## Near Future (1-2 Weeks)
- Generate full requirements list
- Generate task list
- Perform HTA on all tasks

## Mid Future (2-4 Weeks)
- Backend design
- Functional backend prototyping
- Non-functional UI prototyping
- Functional UI prototyping

# Other Notes
- I have decided to forego many of the intermediate steps in requirements gathering because I am personally experienced with this problem, and because the scope of the project is relatively small. While I may conduct some interviews in the future to discover details, artifacts like a workflow diagram and WAAD will not provide enough insight to be worth the time.
