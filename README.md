# Steward
A modern pantry management system

## Project in Progress
Steward is currently in the early concept and research phase. 

# Project Statement
The main goal of Steward is to reduce food waste by keeping track of the items in a household's pantry and refridgerator. When you've held on to an item for a while, or it's nearing its expiration date, your Steward will remind you to use it soon. Steward will make it easy to register new items when you get home from the grocery store. Steward could be aware not only of what items you have, but where they are and what they look like, making it easier to find that one ingredient you rarely use.
Your Steward list can also be shared with other users, so that other members of the household can add items and receive reminders.

# Current Plans
Implement using:
- PostgreSQL
- Express.js
- React Native

# Goals

## Near Future (1-2 Weeks)
- Set up project structure (including internal and external documentation, backend and frontend source, etc.)
- Interview example users
- Derive refined requirements list from user information

## Mid Future (2-4 Weeks)
- Begin functional backend prototyping
- Begin non-functional UI prototyping
